  "summary": "Tech-spec is approved. All critical requirements met: frontmatter complete (status: approved, branch: issue-5268-apps-layout, size: M), all required sections present with detailed content, implementation tasks properly organized in 3 waves with clear dependencies, risks identified with mitigations, agent verification plan concrete and executable, acceptance criteria comprehensive. Tasks use correct skills (code-writing, infrastructure, pre-deploy-qa, post-deploy-qa) and appropriate reviewers. No wave conflicts detected (no file modified by multiple tasks in same wave). Two minor findings are informational only and don't block approval."
